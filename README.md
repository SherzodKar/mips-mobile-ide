## Collaboration Guidelines
# feature implementation convention
- no feature is to be implemented on the master branch
- create a new branch with name feature\<feature-name>

# Project organization
- All core features should be organized in packages

# pull request convention
- add at least 2 reviewers to every pull request
- once pull is merge into master, the feature branch should be deleted

# bugs
- for every bug create an issue
- add the last committer as issue owner if you can't fix it
